## Setting up Reddit API Credentials

To access Reddit data, you need to create a Reddit app and get API credentials:

### Step 1: Create a Reddit App

1. Log in to your Reddit account.
2. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
3. Scroll down and click **"Create App"** or **"Create Another App"**.
4. Fill in:

   * **Name:** e.g., `reddytics`
   * **App type:** Select **script**
   * **Description:** (optional)
   * **Redirect URI:** Use `http://localhost` (this is required but not used in scripts)
5. Click **Create app**.

You will now see your **client ID** (under the app name) and **client secret**.

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

To keep your credentials secure, store them as environment variables.

Create a file named `.env` in your project root with the following content:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=reddytics:v0.1 (by u/your_reddit_username)
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and your Reddit username.

Alternatively, export them in your shell session:

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret_here"
export REDDIT_USER_AGENT="reddytics:v0.1 (by u/your_reddit_username)"
```
